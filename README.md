# CI/CD Node.js Demo App

This is a simple Node.js Express app used to demonstrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using **GitHub Actions** and **DockerHub**.

## 🚀 How it works

- On every push to the `main` branch:
  - GitHub Actions checks out the code
  - Node.js dependencies are installed
  - A Docker image is built from the app
  - The image is pushed automatically to DockerHub

## 🧱Tools & Technologies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- DockerHub

## 📦 Files included

- `app.js` — Main Express server
- `package.json` — Node.js dependencies
- `Dockerfile` — Instructions to build the Docker image
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow file
